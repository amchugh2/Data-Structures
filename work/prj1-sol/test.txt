Hello this is a test file. I am test ing how many times these words appear in a file. At first I was afraid. I was petrified. Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side. But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong, and I grew strong, and I learned how to carry on andso you're back from outer space, kept thinking I would find you here with that sad look upon your face, I should have changed the stupid lock, or made you leave the key, if I had known for just one second you'd be back to bother me.
